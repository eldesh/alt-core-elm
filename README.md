# alt-core-elm

**alt-core-elm** is an extension/alternative to the official
[`elm/core`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/core/1.0.5/) package.
Its goal is to offer additional data-structure utilities and
combinator functions while following Elmâ€™s design principles.

> [!NOTE]
> Only the `Data.List` module is currently implemented.

## Modules

- Data.List

    Expose all standard list functions except for `(::)` from `List` module,
    and provides many other utility functions on lists.

    Extended toolbox for working with lists: everything from `elm/core`
	`List` except for `(::)` plus Haskell-inspired helpers such as
	`nub`, `intercalate`, and `groupBy`, all implemented the Elm way.
