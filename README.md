# alt-core-elm

alt-core is a package for [elm-lang](https://elm-lang.org/), developed to be an extension/alternative to the core package.

This package provides:
- general and basic data structurures and
- combinators (functions) on them


# Modules

This library provides modules as follows:

- Data.List

    Expose all standard list functions except for `(::)` from `List` module,
    and provides many other utility functions on lists.

    Extended toolbox for working with lists: everything from `elm/core`
	`List` except for `(::)` plus Haskell-inspired helpers such as
	`nub`, `intercalate`, and `groupBy`, all implemented the Elm way.
